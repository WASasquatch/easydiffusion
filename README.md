# Stability.AI Easy Diffusion ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=EasyDiffusion-github&left_color=blue&right_color=orange) 

Stability.AI Easy Diffusion is a Google Colab Notebook designed to be a relatively easy to use all-in-one suite for stable diffusion. It is being improved with features frequently. 

### Features
- Text to Image Stable Diffusion
- Image to Image Stable Diffusion
- Inpainting Stable Diffusion
- Enable or Disable NSFW Filtering (Gaussian Blurred Images)
- Cached Pipes - Cache pipes to disk for faster loading between pipe types.
- Optional Attention Slicing
- Define a HF Model not listed by selecting the `MODEL_ID` text and writing in your own model ID, or select from the drop down arrow list of predefined models.
- Stable Diffusion Concept support
- Use local, or remote init images or mask images. 
- Use a text file of init images, masks, or prompts to do batches.
  - `PROMPT_FILE` - Supports line repetition (useful with NSP or random prompts). Use `^#|` at the beginning of your prompt line to define how many times a line should repeat. For example `^5|A cat on a park bench` would repeat `A cat on a park bench` for 5 batches and X iterations. 
- [Noodle Soup Prompts](https://github.com/WASasquatch/noodle-soup-prompts) support for prompts.
- Random word support in `[word1|word2|word3]` syntax, or multiple words in `[^#|word1|word2|word3] format, where `#` is a number determining how many random words from the list to use.
- Negative prompt support built into normal prompts, denote negative prompts at the end of your prompt with `--`. For example `Positive prompt here--Negative prompt here`
- Recursive Evolution - Feed your diffusion result into img2img for evolution. Can be used to create cool animations like below:<br>

- Image Upscaling (Easy Diffusion can be used as a image processor by enabling `SKIP_DIFFUSION_RUN`)
  - GOBIG - Slice a upscaled image up into small tiles to diffuse with img2img, and then compile the final upscaled result. Useful for adding diffusion details at higher resolutions where VRAM wouldn't allow.
  - IMG2IMG - Basic Image to Image upscaling, very VRAM intensive
  - GFPGAN - GFPGAN Face Enhancement
  - CodeFormer - CodeFormer Face Enhancement + Real-ESRGAN
  - Real-SRGAN - Real-ESRGAN Super Resolution
- Image Processing
  - Sharpening
  - Chromatic Aberration
  - Median Filter
  - Depth Output
  - Fake Depth of Field
  - Tileable Texture Output
- CLIP Interrogate
  - Interrogate diffusion results with various CLIP models
  - Interrogate batch images without diffusion (with `SKIP_DIFFUSION_RUN`)
