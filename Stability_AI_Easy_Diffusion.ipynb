        " - Patch image display for FDOF active mode. \n",
        "- **v0.13** | 9/7/2022) Added Attention Slices optimization. This feature splits the job into slices for better use of available VRAM. Use `ENABLE_ATTENTION_SLICES` in diffusion settings to try it out.\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "- **v0.18** | 9/14/2022) Rebuilt `cache_pipes()` function. It now will only cache the type of pipe active, and return said pipe. This will save storage space by only caching the pipes you actually use. \n",

        " - 9/21/2022) More styles added\n",
        "- **v0.20** | 9/24/2022) Added Hybrid Upscaling. Hybrid Upscaling overlays the original diffusion result over the AI Upscale result. Useful for mitigating the flat surfaces and smoothnes of Real-ESRGAN and other AI upscalers.\n",
        " - Added ability to load Easy Diffusion Settings files.  \n",
        "- **v0.21** | 9/25/2022) Added IMG2IMG Upscaling. Inherently since it's using diffusion to upscale, it requires a lot of VRAM. A T4 can do a 512x512 upscale 2x.\n",
        " - Rewrote upscaler setups. They will now only install upon use. \n",
        "- **v1.00** | 9/28/2022) Added **GOBIG** IMG2IMG Upscaling originally by lowfuel. Slice a image up and diffuse each slice, merging them back to form a final upscaled image. This can can create very large scale stylish diffusions. I will try to get a GOBIG guide together. \n",

        " - Optional prompt words. You can specify a word option like follows: `<dog|cat|bird>`, or for `<^^#` to specify a number of random words. Ex: `<^^4|dog|cat|bird>`\n",
        " - Parsing of `INIT_IMAGE` files and paths is now sorted.\n",
        " - Check if CLIP Interrogator is installed before attmepting use. \n",

        "- **v1.1** | 10/4/3033) Disabled pipeline patching for negative prompts as it has been merged with diffusers.\n",
        "- **v1.2** | 10/5/2022) Changed optional prompt words to use `[` and `]` instead of `<` and `>`\n",
        " - Added [Stable Diffusion Concept](https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library) support\n",
        " - Added support for prompt line repeating. Specify how many times a prompt should be used in successive batches with `^#|The prompt` for example `^5|A cat sitting on a bench` would repeat `A cat sitting on a bench` for 5 batches.\n",
        " - `RECURSIVE_EVOLUTION` supports `INIT_IMAGE` and init or prompt batches.\n",
        " - `RECURSIVE_EVOLUTION` supports hybrid frames. Example; you're on frame 4, frame 2 will be overlayed on frame 3, which is fed as the `INIT_IMAGE` for frame 4.\n",
        "- 10/14/2022) Pipes have been updated for new image retrieval method.\n",
        " - Added adjustable thumbnail sizes for JS image mode.\n",
        "- 10/21/2022) Add Stable Diffusion v1.5 and 1.5 Inpainting\n",
        "- **v1.3** | 11/05/2022) Added LPW Pipeline as main ED pipeline. Pipe supports long prompts, and prompt weights. \n",
        " - Added **Euler_A** and **Euler** Samplers\n",
        "- 11/11/2022) Added DPM Solver++ Sampler"
